# Configure Amazon SageMaker Studio

## Overview

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale.

Amazon SageMaker removes the complexity that holds back developer success with each of these steps; indeed, it includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models.

In this section, you will access AWS Console and Amazon SageMaker Studio, and clone this repository in your SageMaker Studio environment.

## Access the AWS Console

### Self-paced using your AWS account
Open AWS Console by navigating to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://console.aws.amazon.com/</a>, then follow the steps in the [Open SageMaker Studio](#open-amazon-sagemaker-studio) section further down on this page. 

### AWS Event using Workshop Studio
If you're running these labs as part of an AWS led event, we will be using Workshop Studio to provision temporary accounts for you, with everything you need to complete the workshop pre-provisioned. While there are some limits to these accounts, we do encourage you experiment and try out a few things!

1. Browse to [**Workshop Studio**](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/), and click **Get Started**. Alternatively, use the direct URL provided by your facilitator to access the event.

2. Select **Email one-time password (OTP)**, then enter your email address. Your facilitator should have whitelisted your email address and/or email domain to allow access to the event. Click **Send passcode**.

</p>

4. If you've been provided with a direct URL, you can skip this step. Otherwise, enter the event code provided by your facilitator.

</p>

5. Review the Terms and Conditions, mark the checkbox next to I agree... and click Join event

<p align="center">
	<img src="./images/ws_review.jpeg" alt="Event Engine login" width="600px" />
</p>

6. You'll see the steps for the workshop on the left. To access your AWS account, click **Open AWS console** in the bottom left hand corner. You may want to copy this sign-in url and open the console in a new window or browser.

<p align="center">

</p>

You should now have access to your temporary AWS account. Note that this is a temporary account and will be cleaned up when the event is terminated. In Workshop Studio, you should see a notice with the time remaining for the account.

4. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, make sure you are in the **US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1]** AWS region.

## Open Amazon SageMaker Studio
Amazon SageMaker Studio has been pre-configured in the AWS Account. In this section we will open Studio and clone the repository.

1. In the AWS Management Console, search for "SageMaker" and select Amazon SageMaker in the results.
